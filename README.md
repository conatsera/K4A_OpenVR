# K4A_OpenVR
The calibrator is a temporary solution and currently requires sensor placement to be on either the X or Z axis.

**WARNING**: This project may or may not receive further work as I work on an OpenXR runtime that will include OpenVR integration.
## CMake variables
Set the Qt5_DIR variable to your Qt build platform of choice (ex: `D:/Qt/5.12.5/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake/Qt5` )

K4A_SDK_ROOT and K4ABT_ROOT may be overridden for custom install directories. Left unset it will search the default install directory for Windows.
